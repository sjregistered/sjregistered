I am a software engineer intern currently working with amantya technologies for front end development and learning git and many thing along with it like I am doing UI and UX also 
and want to learn as much as possible under the guidance of my superb mentor who is filled with so much knowledge to offer. I am so grateful to amantya technologies for providing me
the opportunity to create my career with their prestigious and highly cultured organisation. Really enjoying my work which is offering me to learn and grow and would be uploading my
projects which are to my personal only here as a public repository and had to learn git also for the company purposes. Thank you, have a good day.
